# ESP8266

Explorations into using the ESP8266

So far I am being naughty and connecting the RX and TX of my ESP8266 directly to the 5V pins of an Uno. No smoke yet!

I am particularly trying to make a remote energy monitor for renewable systems which displays info on an LCD screen and pushes data to either Thingspeak or emoncms as and when there's an available internet connection.
