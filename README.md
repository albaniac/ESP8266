# ESP8266

Explorations into using the ESP8266

So far I am being naughty and connecting the RX and TX of my ESP8266 directly to the 5V pins of an Uno. No smoke yet!

I am particularly trying to make a remote energy monitor for renewable systems which displays info on an LCD screen and pushes data to either Thingspeak or emoncms as and when there's an available internet connection.

Presently posting my household electricity consumption to Emoncms using a CT clamp around main incommer using hardware and software outlined in this post
